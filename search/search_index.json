I often find great tutorials and interesting content in other author's blogs. But, I frankly do not have the time or energy needed to maintain a blog that would be worth reading. I gave this issue a lot of thought and ultimately decided that what would be simpler would be a site where I could jot down my notes and findings on various topics in a less idempotent way. Blogs suffer from the traditional expectation that each article, once written, will not change over time. This puts a ton of pressure on blog authors to fully explore and expound upon their ideas on the first draft.
