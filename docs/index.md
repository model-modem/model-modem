## Rationale 
The concept of a blog has always appealed to me.  I often find great tutorials and interesting content in other author's blogs.  But, I frankly do not have the time or energy needed to maintain a blog that would be worth reading.  I gave this issue a lot of thought and ultimately decided that what would be simpler would be a site where I could jot down my notes and findings on various topics in a less [idempotent][1] way.  Blogs suffer from the traditional expectation that each article, once written, will not change over time.  This puts a ton of pressure on blog authors to fully explore and expound upon their ideas on the first draft.  

What this site is attempting to achieve is a to present an evolving compendium generally composed of technical findings and documentation.  Each page is subject to change and may move around as time goes on.
